This Python script will examine a dataset with two columns—Date and Profit/Losses—and analyze a company's financial records.

The records will be examined by this Python script, which will calculate each of the following:

Months included in the dataset as a whole

The total net profit or loss for the entire time period

Over the course of the entire period, the average change in profit or loss

The day and amount when profits increased by the most overall

The day and amount when losses decreased most dramatically overall
